## Unofficial yotta Target Description using GCC to compile for STM32F446 NUCLEO Board

Use this target description to compile [mbed
OS](http://www.mbed.com/en/development/software/mbed-os/) for the [NUCLEO F446RE](http://www.mbed.com/en/development/hardware/boards/)
using GCC.

This target description derives from the generic
[mbed-gcc](https://github.com/ARMmbed/target-mbed-gcc) target description,
which provides most of the information about how to run the compiler.
